            <u>Founder's comment</u>: A major cause for climate change is the
            pollution from developed nations' unsustainable practices. <br>
            The cost of localised growth has had a global price tag, which calls
            for funneling the benefits of innovation towards those who would
            otherwise suffer the most.

            <u>Note</u>: The mission of the initiative explicitly excludes
            preventative measures and is focused on adaptation.
