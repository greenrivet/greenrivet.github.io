            <u>Founder's comment</u>: A major cause for climate change is the
            pollution from developed nations' unsustainable practices. <br>
            The cost of localised growth has had a global price tag, which calls
            for funneling the benefits of innovation towards those who would
            otherwise suffer the most.

          <p><i>
            <u>Note</u>: The mission of the initiative explicitly excludes
            preventative measures and is focused on adaptation.

          The <i>green</i> in the initiative's name symbolises
          <i>life and sustainability</i> and <i>rivet</i> communicates
          <i>determination and permanence</i>. <br>
          Together they stand for an adaptive force binding the land and its
          inhabitants.
